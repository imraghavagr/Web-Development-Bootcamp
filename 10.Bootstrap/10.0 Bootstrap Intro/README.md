# Bootstrap 


> use https://getbootstrap.com/

- It is one of the many external css layout system.s
- This is the most popular one. 
- It is a css framework created in 2010 by two twitter developers. 
- This is so popular because it contains premaid css files which we can simply include in our project in order to use their prebuild components and styling.
- One major reason for bootstrap becoming so popular is their 12-column layout system which is built on top of flexbox that makes it very easy to create responsive websites. 


**How does it actually work ?**

1. For styling anything we will bring over its css styling code and paste it into bootstrap.css
2. We do not need to worry about the code written in step1, we just need to add the classes (given in the website) to our component.

**Bootstrap is completely open-source.**

> Two most famouse external css frameworks are bootstrap and foundation. But there are lots more present such as tailwind, m ui, etc.
