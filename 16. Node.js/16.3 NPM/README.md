# NPM - Node Package Manager 

It is basically a place which collects modules which people have made for node. It is made by GitHub organization and it's really great place to find code that other people have written. This can helps us in writting our node applications.

It is our shared code library. 

## initialise npm 
-> npm init

## installing any npm package
npm install <packageName1> <packageName2> ...

## ECMAScript Modules (ESM)

We have to ways to get node modules:

1. CJS - Common JS    
    Using require keyword 
    
2. ESM
    Instead of using require we can use import keyword
