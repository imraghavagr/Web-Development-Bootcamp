# Express.js Framework - A framework built on top of Node

## Basic Introduction:

- There are many programming languages for building backend, and in addition to languages, there are 
also a bunch of frameworks that we can choose e.g. node.js, django, asp.net etc 
- The framework that uses JavaScript is Node.js, but strictly speacking Node.js is not a js framework, but it is a js runtime environment, i.e. it allows us to run js on our computer. 
- Express on the otherhand is a js framework that allows us to create our backend using js. 
- Node and Express combined is how most professional developers built their website backend. 

## Why Express.js when node.js is already present?

- We can use Node to do a lot of things like creating backend, make desktop applications or anything. Node is used to do a lot of things and thus it is not specialised for creating website backend.

- Scredriver Analogy: Consider that we want to tighten a screw (consider it js). To do this we can use node.js (a normal screw-driver) which will take a lot of time, or else we can use an spcialised electric screw-driver (express.js). 

- Express allows us to use js and node to create our website backend and its make the process so much easier and quicker. 

- Some advantages of using ExpressJS:
    1. Inhances Readability.
    2. We need to write less code.
    3. Ability to add Middleware.
